# ShareNote Deployment Pre-Flight Check ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Critical Risk Assessment

### üî¥ HIGH RISK Issues

#### 1. Database Migration Risks
**Risk**: Prisma migration might fail or cause downtime
```sql
-- Migration adds non-nullable columns without defaults
ALTER TABLE "documents" 
ADD COLUMN "htmlContent" TEXT,
ADD COLUMN "renderMode" VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'markdown';
```

**Potential Issues**:
- Migration locks table during deployment
- Existing documents will have `null` htmlContent  
- `renderMode` defaults to 'markdown' but code expects both values
- Large document table could cause long migration time

**Mitigation**:
- Run migration during low-traffic period
- Add indexes after migration completes
- Verify existing documents work with new schema
- Prepare rollback script

#### 2. Frontend Import.meta Environment Variable Issue
**Risk**: ViewPage uses `import.meta.env` which works in dev but might fail in production build

**Current Code**:
```typescript
// This might break in production Vite build
this.baseUrl = import.meta.env?.VITE_API_URL || '/api';
```

**Potential Issues**:
- Production build might not replace import.meta correctly
- Different behavior between dev/prod environments
- ViewPage fails to load documents

**Mitigation**:
- Test production build locally first
- Verify environment variables are injected correctly
- Have fallback API URL ready

#### 3. DOMPurify Package Compatibility
**Risk**: New DOMPurify dependency might conflict with existing packages or cause bundle size issues

**Potential Issues**:
- Version conflicts with existing dependencies
- Increases bundle size significantly
- Different behavior between server/client DOMPurify
- CSP (Content Security Policy) issues

**Mitigation**:
- Verify bundle size increase is acceptable
- Test XSS protection thoroughly in production
- Ensure CSP allows DOMPurify to function

### üü° MEDIUM RISK Issues

#### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Changes
**Risk**: Modified CI/CD pipeline might fail or take too long

**Changes Made**:
- Added plugin dependency installation
- Added plugin testing steps  
- Added plugin build steps
- Added E2E tests for ShareNote

**Potential Issues**:
- Plugin npm install might fail
- Tests might timeout in CI environment
- Build artifacts might not be uploaded correctly
- E2E tests might be flaky

**Mitigation**:
- Test CI/CD pipeline on feature branch first
- Set appropriate timeouts for new steps
- Verify plugin builds are deployed correctly

#### 5. Obsidian Plugin Distribution
**Risk**: Plugin replacement might break for existing users

**Potential Issues**:
- Existing plugin users lose functionality
- Settings/configuration lost during upgrade
- Plugin not compatible with older Obsidian versions
- Users need to reconfigure backend URL

**Mitigation**:
- Document migration steps for users
- Test plugin compatibility with multiple Obsidian versions
- Provide clear upgrade instructions
- Consider backwards compatibility period

#### 6. CORS Configuration Changes
**Risk**: Modified CORS might break existing integrations

**Potential Issues**:
- Existing web app might lose API access
- Browser security policies reject requests
- New ShareNote requests blocked by CORS
- Development vs production CORS differences

**Mitigation**:
- Test CORS with actual Obsidian app
- Verify existing web app still works
- Test both development and production environments

### üü¢ LOW RISK Issues

#### 7. Route Conflicts
**Risk**: New `/view/:documentId` route might conflict with existing routes

**Potential Issues**:
- Route precedence issues
- Existing `/share/:documentId` behavior affected
- Client-side routing conflicts

**Mitigation**:
- Test both routes work correctly
- Verify no route collisions occur

#### 8. Performance Impact
**Risk**: HTML rendering and sanitization might slow down responses

**Potential Issues**:
- ViewPage loads slowly with large HTML content
- DOMPurify sanitization takes significant time
- Increased memory usage from dual content storage

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor response times after deployment
- Consider HTML caching strategies
- Set up performance monitoring

## Environment-Specific Risks

### Production Environment Checks

#### Database
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL version compatibility with new migration
- [ ] Check available disk space for additional HTML content storage
- [ ] Confirm database backup before migration
- [ ] Test migration rollback procedure

#### Server Resources
- [ ] Verify Node.js version supports new dependencies
- [ ] Check available memory for DOMPurify processing
- [ ] Confirm CPU capacity for HTML sanitization
- [ ] Monitor disk space usage post-deployment

#### Network & Security
- [ ] Test HTTPS compatibility with new routes
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates work with ViewPage
- [ ] Check CDN configuration for new static assets
- [ ] Validate security headers don't block HTML rendering

#### Third-Party Dependencies
- [ ] Verify npm registry access for new packages
- [ ] Check if corporate firewall blocks DOMPurify
- [ ] Confirm Docker base image supports new dependencies
- [ ] Test package vulnerability scanning passes

## Deployment Sequence Risks

### 1. Database-First Deployment
**Risk**: Deploy database changes before application changes

**Issues**:
- Application tries to use new columns before they exist
- Old code might break with new schema

### 2. Application-First Deployment  
**Risk**: Deploy application before database migration

**Issues**:
- New code fails when trying to access non-existent columns
- HTML content features don't work until DB updated

### 3. Partial Deployment
**Risk**: Only some services get updated

**Issues**:
- Backend updated but frontend still old (no ViewPage)
- Frontend updated but backend doesn't support HTML
- Plugin updated but backend not ready

## Testing Gaps & Blind Spots

### Missing Test Coverage
1. **Production Environment**: No tests run against actual production setup
2. **Large HTML Content**: No tests with very large HTML documents  
3. **Unicode/Internationalization**: HTML sanitization with various character sets
4. **Concurrent Users**: Multiple users accessing same HTML document
5. **Browser Compatibility**: ViewPage only tested in Chromium
6. **Mobile Devices**: HTML rendering on actual mobile devices
7. **Network Issues**: Slow connections, timeouts, partial loads

### Integration Gaps
1. **Plugin ‚Üí Backend ‚Üí Frontend**: Full end-to-end flow not tested in production environment
2. **Authentication**: Plugin sharing might need auth tokens
3. **Rate Limiting**: High volume HTML sharing might hit limits
4. **Content Size Limits**: Very large HTML content handling

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback (< 1 hour)
1. **Revert CI/CD pipeline** to previous version
2. **Deploy previous application version** from backup
3. **Disable new routes** via load balancer if needed
4. **Keep database changes** (safer than rolling back data)

### Full Rollback (if database issues)
1. **Stop all services**  
2. **Restore database from backup**
3. **Deploy previous application version**
4. **Verify existing functionality works**
5. **Document what went wrong for post-mortem**

### Partial Rollback Options
- **Disable ViewPage route** only (keep existing features)
- **Rollback plugin only** (keep backend changes)
- **Disable HTML features** via feature flag

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Blue-Green Deployment
- Deploy to staging environment first
- Test thoroughly with production data copy
- Switch traffic gradually using load balancer
- Keep old version running as backup

### Feature Flags
```javascript
// Add feature flags for new functionality
const HTML_VIEWING_ENABLED = process.env.FEATURE_HTML_VIEWING === 'true';
const SHARENOTE_PLUGIN_ENABLED = process.env.FEATURE_SHARENOTE_PLUGIN === 'true';
```

### Database Safety
- Run migration during maintenance window
- Use database connection pooling for large migrations
- Monitor database performance during and after migration
- Have DBA available during deployment

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Set up alerts for new endpoint failures
- Monitor HTML sanitization performance
- Track ViewPage error rates
- Alert on unusual traffic patterns

## Success Criteria

### Deployment is successful if:
