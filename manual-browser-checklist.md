## Manual Browser Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Basic Interface Loading
1. ✅ Open https://obsidiancomments.serverado.app/editor/cmdwl766o0003uvwlbqwn071k
2. ✅ Verify page loads without blank screen
3. ✅ Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
4. ✅ Confirm no "Type with name content already defined" errors
5. ✅ Verify React app mounted (HTML should show content, not just loading)

**Expected**: Page should load with editor interface visible

### Step 2: Editor Functionality
1. ✅ Locate the editor area (should see cursor in text area)
2. ✅ Try typing some text
3. ✅ Verify text appears as you type
4. ✅ Test basic formatting (bold, italic if available)
5. ✅ Check that editor is responsive

**Expected**: Text input should work smoothly without delays or errors

### Step 3: Collaboration Features
1. ✅ Open the same URL in a second browser tab/window
2. ✅ Type in one tab and check if it appears in the other
3. ✅ Verify user presence indicators (colored cursors/avatars)
4. ✅ Check WebSocket connection status
5. ✅ Test simultaneous editing from both tabs

**Expected**: Changes should sync in real-time between tabs

### Step 4: Persistence Test
1. ✅ Type some unique text (e.g., "Test 2025-08-04 persistence")
2. ✅ Wait 2-3 seconds for sync
3. ✅ Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
4. ✅ Check if the text persists after refresh
5. ✅ Verify no data loss occurred

**Expected**: All text changes should persist after page refresh

### Step 5: Error Monitoring
1. ✅ Keep browser console open (F12 → Console)
2. ✅ Monitor for any JavaScript errors during use
3. ✅ Check Network tab for failed requests
4. ✅ Look for CSP violations or security warnings
5. ✅ Monitor for memory leaks (refresh a few times)

**Expected**: No critical errors, warnings should be minimal
